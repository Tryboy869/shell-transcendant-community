```

## Development Workflow

### Git Operations
```bash

./app.sh "show most recently modified files"
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Dependencies
./app.sh "list project dependencies"
./app.sh "check for outdated packages"
./app.sh "show package sizes"

# Build and test
./app.sh "run project tests"
./app.sh "check code style"
./app.sh "analyze code complexity"

# Documentation
./app.sh "find undocumented functions"
./app.sh "generate project documentation"
./app.sh "check markdown files for broken links"
```

## Network and Security

### Network Analysis
```bash
# Connection monitoring
./app.sh "show active network connections"
./app.sh "check internet connectivity"
./app.sh "monitor bandwidth usage"
./app.sh "find which process is using port 8080"

# Network troubleshooting
./app.sh "test connection to specific server"
./app.sh "trace route to website"
./app.sh "check DNS resolution"
```

### Security Checks
```bash
# System security
./app.sh "check file permissions for security issues"
./app.sh "find files with unusual permissions"
./app.sh "show failed login attempts"

# Application security
./app.sh "scan for common vulnerabilities"
./app.sh "check for suspicious processes"
./app.sh "audit system configuration"
```

## Data Processing

### Text Processing
```bash
# File content analysis
./app.sh "find most common words in text files"
./app.sh "count occurrences of specific pattern"
./app.sh "extract email addresses from files"

# Data transformation
./app.sh "convert CSV to JSON format"
./app.sh "merge multiple text files"
./app.sh "remove duplicate lines from file"
```

### Log Processing
```bash
# Log analysis
./app.sh "extract unique IP addresses from web logs"
./app.sh "find most requested URLs"
./app.sh "analyze error patterns in logs"

# Reporting
./app.sh "generate daily usage report"
./app.sh "create performance summary"
./app.sh "export error statistics"
```

## Advanced Examples

### Automation Tasks
```bash
# Maintenance
./app.sh "clean up old log files"
./app.sh "update system package list"
./app.sh "backup configuration files"

# Monitoring
./app.sh "alert if disk usage exceeds 80%"
./app.sh "check service availability"
./app.sh "monitor application health"
```

### Complex Operations
```bash
# Multi-step operations
./app.sh "backup database and compress files"
./app.sh "deploy application with health checks"
./app.sh "sync files and verify integrity"

# Conditional operations
./app.sh "restart service if not responding"
./app.sh "clean cache if disk space low"
./app.sh "update dependencies if outdated"
```

## Interactive Examples

### Learning Mode
```bash
# Show generated commands
./app.sh "show me the actual command for listing files"
./app.sh "explain how to find large files"
./app.sh "teach me about file permissions"

# Safe exploration
./app.sh "what would happen if I delete this file"
./app.sh "show me safe ways to clean up disk space"
./app.sh "explain this complex command"
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Problem diagnosis
./app.sh "help me diagnose slow system performance"
./app.sh "why is my disk full"
./app.sh "what is consuming my memory"

# Solution finding
./app.sh "suggest ways to improve performance"
./app.sh "how can I free up disk space"
./app.sh "what processes can I safely stop"
```

## Tips for Effective Usage

### Best Practices
1. **Be specific**: "find log files from today" vs "find files"
2. **Use context**: "check CPU usage of web server" vs "check CPU"
3. **Confirm destructive actions**: Always review before deleting
4. **Use learning mode**: Understand the generated commands

### Common Patterns
- Start with simple, safe operations
- Use dry-run mode for destructive operations
- Review generated commands before execution
- Build up to more complex operations gradually

### Safety Guidelines
- Always review commands that modify files
- Use confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Keep backups of important data
- Test commands in safe environments first
