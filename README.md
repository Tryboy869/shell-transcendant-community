# New Shell üíö

*A natural language interface for shell commands - Making terminal accessible to everyone*

## What is New Shell?

New Shell transforms complex shell commands into natural, conversational syntax. Instead of memorizing arcane command-line syntax, simply describe what you want to accomplish.

```bash
# Traditional shell
find . -name "*.log" -exec grep -l "ERROR" {} \; | wc -l

# New Shell
./new_shell "count log files containing errors"
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and make executable
git clone https://github.com/Tryboy869/new-shell.git
cd new-shell
chmod +x app.sh

# First run
./app.sh "help me get started"
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# File operations
./app.sh "backup all text files to archive folder"
./app.sh "find large files bigger than 100MB"
./app.sh "compress logs older than 7 days"

# System monitoring
./app.sh "show system performance"
./app.sh "check disk space usage"
./app.sh "monitor running processes"

# Development tasks
./app.sh "find TODO comments in code"
./app.sh "count lines of code in project"
./app.sh "check git status and recent changes"
```

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language**: Describe tasks in plain English
- üîí **Security First**: Multi-layer protection against malicious commands
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Generates optimized shell scripts
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Execution**: Automatic validation and sandboxing
- üìö **Learning Mode**: See the generated shell commands
- üîß **Extensible**: Add custom command patterns

## How It Works

1. **Parse**: Natural language input analyzed
2. **Translate**: Converted to optimal shell commands
3. **Validate**: Security checks and verification
4. **Execute**: Run safely with monitoring
5. **Learn**: Generated commands shown for education

## Security

New Shell prioritizes security through multiple layers:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Command whitelisting and pattern matching
- Execution sandboxing
- Audit logging
- Automatic updates with verification

For security researchers: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## Examples

### File Management
```bash
./app.sh "organize downloads by file type"
./app.sh "find duplicate files in current folder"
./app.sh "create backup of project excluding node_modules"
```

### System Administration
```bash
./app.sh "show network connections"
./app.sh "check system logs for errors"
./app.sh "monitor CPU usage every 5 seconds"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
./app.sh "setup git hooks for code quality"
./app.sh "find memory leaks in log files"
./app.sh "deploy to staging with health checks"
```

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0+ (most systems)
- Internet connection (for core engine updates)
- Git (for installation and updates)
