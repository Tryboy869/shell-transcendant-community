# Security Policy

## Security Architecture

New Shell implements multiple layers of security to protect against malicious command execution and ensure safe operation.

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

#### 1. Input Validation Layer
- **Length Limits**: Commands limited to 1000 characters
- **Pattern Matching**: Blacklist of dangerous command patterns
- **Encoding Validation**: Prevents command injection via encoding
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents automated attacks

#### 2. Command Translation Security
- **Whitelist Approach**: Only known safe patterns translated
- **Context Awareness**: Commands validated against current environment
- **Permission Checking**: User permissions validated before execution
- **Sandbox Preparation**: Commands prepared for safe execution

#### 3. Execution Security
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Destructive commands require user confirmation
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview commands before execution
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time constraints
- **Audit Logging**: All commands logged with timestamps

#### 4. Core Engine Security
- **Encrypted Communication**: All communications with core engine encrypted
- **Signature Verification**: Core engine updates cryptographically signed
- **Version Control**: Only verified versions downloaded
- **Isolation**: Core engine runs in isolated environment

### Dangerous Pattern Detection

The following patterns are automatically blocked:

```bash
# File system destruction
rm -rf /
format c:
> /dev/sda
dd if=
mkfs
fdisk

# Code execution
eval
exec
curl.*|.*bash
wget.*|.*sh

# System modification
sudo rm
chmod 777
chown root
```

### Safe Command Examples

‚úÖ **SAFE** - These commands are allowed:
```bash
# File operations
ls, find, grep, cat, head, tail
cp (with confirmation), mv (with confirmation)
mkdir, touch

# System information
ps, top, df, free, uptime, who
netstat, ss, lsof

# Development tools
git status, git log, git diff
npm list, pip list
docker ps, docker images
```

‚ùå **BLOCKED** - These commands are automatically prevented:
```bash
# Destructive operations
rm -rf /, format, fdisk, mkfs
sudo rm, chmod 777, chown root

# Remote execution
curl | bash, wget | sh
ssh commands with pipe execution

# System modification
systemctl stop, service stop
iptables flush, ufw disable
```

### Core Engine Security

The core engine (private repository) implements additional security measures:

#### 1. Cryptographic Protection
- **AES-256 Encryption**: All core logic encrypted at rest
- **RSA Signatures**: Each release cryptographically signed
- **Hash Verification**: Integrity checks on all components
- **Key Rotation**: Regular security key updates

#### 2. Access Control
- **GitHub Token Authentication**: Secure API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional restriction to known IP ranges
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all access attempts

#### 3. Update Security
- **Automatic Updates**: Core engine updates automatically
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant rollback if issues detected
- **Staged Deployment**: Updates tested before release
- **Version Pinning**: Users can pin specific versions

### Privacy Protection

#### Data Handling
- **No Command Storage**: Natural language commands not permanently stored
- **Local Processing**: Maximum processing done locally
- **Minimal Telemetry**: Only essential usage statistics collected
- **User Control**: All telemetry can be disabled

#### Network Security
- **TLS 1.3**: All network communications encrypted
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Timeout Controls**: Prevents hanging connections
- **Proxy Support**: Works with corporate proxies

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep New Shell updated to latest version
2. **Review Commands**: Always review generated commands before execution
3. **Use Confirmation**: Enable confirmation for destructive operations
4. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check `~/.new-shell/new-shell.log`
5. **Report Issues**: Report suspicious behavior immediately

#### For Administrators
1. **Network Restrictions**: Consider firewall rules for core engine access
2. **User Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege
3. **Audit Configuration**: Enable comprehensive logging
4. **Update Policies**: Establish update testing procedures
5. **Incident Response**: Have response plan for security issues

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security concerns to: nexusstudio100@gmail.com
3. **Include** detailed description and reproduction steps
4. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure
5. **Follow** coordinated disclosure timeline

### Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates severity
3. **Fix Development**: Patch developed and tested
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure
5. **Recognition**: Security researchers credited (with permission)

### Threat Model

#### Assumptions
- User has legitimate access to their system
- Network connection to GitHub is available
- Operating system provides basic security primitives
- User understands basic security concepts

#### Threat Scenarios
1. **Malicious Input**: User provides crafted input to execute harmful commands
2. **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle attacks on core engine communication
3. **Local Attacks**: Local privilege escalation via New Shell
4. **Supply Chain**: Compromise of core engine or dependencies

#### Mitigations
- Multi-layer input validation and command sanitization
- Cryptographic protection of network communications
- Minimal privilege requirements and sandboxed execution
- Signed releases and integrity verification

### Compliance and Standards

New Shell follows industry security standards:

- **OWASP**: Secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity framework compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles
- **CIS Controls**: Critical security controls implementation

### Security Metrics

We track and publish the following security metrics:

- **Vulnerability Response Time**: Average time to patch security issues
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of safe commands incorrectly blocked
- **Update Success Rate**: Percentage of successful automatic updates
- **Incident Count**: Number of security incidents per quarter

### Security Tools Integration

New Shell integrates with common security tools:

```bash
# Security scanning
./app.sh "scan for malware in downloads"
./app.sh "check file permissions for security issues"
./app.sh "audit system for compliance"

# Monitoring
./app.sh "show suspicious network connections"
./app.sh "check for failed login attempts"
./app.sh "monitor system integrity"
```
